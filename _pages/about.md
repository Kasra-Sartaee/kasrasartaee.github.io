I am an MSc Artificial Intelligence student at University College London with a First Class BSc in Computer Science. My research interests center on evaluation, reliability, and human alignment of AI systems, particularly in settings where automated metrics diverge from human judgment.

My recent work focuses on generative AI for music and media, with an emphasis on evaluation beyond surface-level fidelity. I am the author of EchoScript, a script-aware fine-tuning framework for cinematic music generation, published at an AAAI Summer Symposium. Through this work, I became especially interested in the limitations of black-box generation and the role of structured evaluation, perceptual alignment, and uncertainty-aware assessment in modern AI systems.

More broadly, I am interested in:

Human-centered and perception-driven AI evaluation

Reliability and robustness of generative models

Misalignment between automated metrics and human judgment

AI systems grounded in real-world signals rather than static benchmarks

Music and audio are one application domain I work in, but my core research interests extend to areas such as scientific machine learning, embodied or dynamic systems, and AI evaluated against physical or biological reality.

I am currently exploring PhD directions and funded doctoral opportunities, with a focus on strong supervisor fit, long-term intellectual growth, and research that bridges theory with real-world evaluation challenges.
